--------------------------------------------
If you want to make a good pull request, make sure it includes:

1. Something that will contribute to the community, for example, if we made an error in the code, try to help fix it.
2. Use constructive criticism, don't just say, "your stupid butt made an error in one of the lines of code," be specific, which line of code? Are there multiple? What type of error is it? Do you know how to fix it? If not, do you know where we could go to try to fix it? And don't name call, this is a professional enviroment.
3. If you aren't sure how to do these things, have any sort of question(s) or maybe you don't understand these contributing guidelines, email us at projectmapwar@gmail.com.
--------------------------------------------
If you want to point out an issue, make sure to include:

1. What the issue is.
2. How to fix it or a link to place where we could figure out how to fix it.
3. And of course, be specific about it.
4. Don't name call.
5. Don't email me about me about it, my email is for VERY specific concerns or questions that you COULD NOT find anywhere here.
6. If the issue is in a file that is located in the branch "old-versions," it is not going to be fixed.
--------------------------------------------
Your very basic expectations EVERYWHERE around this page are:

1. Don't name call(as usual).
2. My email is for VERY specific concerns or questions that you COULD NOT find anywhere here.
3. Please, don't discuss things that involve politics or religion or really anything that doesn't have to do with Project Map War.
4. Review the code of conduct AND these rules.
--------------------------------------------
What you can use my email for:

1. Specific questions or concerns.
2. Reporting someone who is being toxic(if you don't know what that means, its basically someone who's doing the exact opposite of helping and being kind) if we somehow don't see it.
3. If you feel we missed something IMPORTANT, not just some random thing that only really needs the basics of it explained or covered in general(if you aren't sure, think about it for a few minutes, if you still aren't sure whether or not it's important, you can email me).
4. Only report typos if they make something HARD to understand.
--------------------------------------------
If you feel I missed something important, again, email me at projectmapwar@gmail.com but this is all I feel needs to be covered.
